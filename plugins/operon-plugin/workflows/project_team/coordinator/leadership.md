# Leadership Spawn Phase

THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. DO NOT SKIP.

Spawn ALL 4 Leadership agents with `requires_answer: true` and `type` set to their role folder name (required for phase updates):
1. Composability (type: composability) -- review through composability lens, identify axes
2. Terminology (type: terminology) -- identify domain terms, define canonical meanings
3. Skeptic (type: skeptic) -- challenge assumptions, identify risks and failure modes
4. UserAlignment (type: user_alignment) -- verify vision captures user intent, flag gaps

VERIFY: Run `list_agents`. Confirm all 4 are visible.

Conditionally spawn:
- Researcher -- if project involves prior art, external libraries, or scientific methods
- LabNotebook -- if project involves experiments or iterative hypothesis testing

All paths in agent prompts MUST be absolute paths.
