# Specification Phase

1. Challenge assumptions in the vision
2. Identify risks and failure modes
3. Distinguish essential complexity (inherent to the problem) from accidental (poor design)
4. Flag shortcuts disguised as simplicity
5. Flag designs that introduce layers, abstractions, or multi-phase engines when a simpler approach solves the same problem. If a proposal has more than 2 moving parts, ask: can this be done with 1?
6. Check for complexity carried over from previous spec revisions. When a spec is re-presented after user feedback, verify that old complexity was actually removed -- not just shuffled. Users simplify for a reason; do not let earlier over-engineering sneak back in
7. Write findings to specification/skeptic_review.md
8. Report to Coordinator

## Communicating findings

Send findings via `message_agent("${COORDINATOR_NAME}", ...)` with the default `requires_answer=true` -- you are awaiting the coordinator's routing decision (which agent absorbs which finding). Use `requires_answer=false` only when reporting a confirmation or a "no concerns" check-in.
