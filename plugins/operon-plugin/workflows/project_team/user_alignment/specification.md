# Specification Phase

1. Read userprompt.md -- extract core requirements
2. Note explicit user preferences and domain terms
3. Verify vision captures user intent -- flag any gaps
4. Check: does spec change user's wording? Flag wording changes.
5. Check: are domain terms understood correctly by the team?
6. Write findings to specification/user_alignment.md
7. Report to Coordinator

## Communicating findings

Send findings via `message_agent("${COORDINATOR_NAME}", ...)` with `requires_answer=true` -- specification-phase findings need the coordinator's decision before the spec can be finalized (override Skeptic, escalate to user, or accept). Use `requires_answer=false` only for "no concerns" check-ins.
