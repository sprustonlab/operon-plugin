# Testing Specification Phase

Re-read your identity.md to refresh your user alignment lens.
Read ${ARTIFACT_DIR}/userprompt_testing.md to understand what tests are planned.

## Generalprobe Standard

Unless explicitly specified otherwise in userprompt_testing.md, all tests
must follow the Generalprobe standard:

- Every test is a full dress rehearsal against real infrastructure
- No mocking -- real servers, real transport, real storage. Mocks prove nothing about production readiness.
- No skipping -- if a test fails on a platform, fix it. Do not use pytest.skip(), xfail, or importorskip.
- No xfail -- known bugs are bugs. Fix them, don't mark them as expected failures.
- Public API only -- test through the project's public interface with opaque handles. Never hardcode internal IDs.
- Production-identical -- the system runs exactly as it would in production. Same startup, same protocol, same API.
- Opaque handles -- handles come from the API (e.g. get_with_handle()), never hardcoded as integers or inspected for type.

## Review the testing vision through your lens

- Does every user requirement have a corresponding test case?
- Are there spec sections with no test coverage?
- Does the testing approach satisfy any explicit user constraints (e.g., "must use VMs", "must actually run DC")?
- Do the proposed tests comply with the Generalprobe standard?
- Any scope creep or scope shrink in the test plan vs what the user asked for?

## Communicating findings

Send findings via `message_agent("${COORDINATOR_NAME}", ...)` with `requires_answer=true` for scope changes (creep or shrink) -- those need the coordinator's decision before the test spec is approvable. Use `requires_answer=false` for advisory flags and confirmations.
